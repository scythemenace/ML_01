## What is Machine Learning
Essentially **machine learning** relies heavily on what data it has. The **more** data it has, the **better** it works.

**Arthur Samuel**'s **checkers** story is a famous example of how Machine Learning can be used to create a system that can learn and improve over time. In the 1950s, Samuel developed a program that could play checkers against itself and learn from its mistakes. By playing millions of games against itself, the program was able to improve its performance to the point where it could beat a human opponent. This was a significant achievement at the time and helped to establish the field of Machine Learning as a legitimate area of research.

Since the AI had played so many games against itself, it just got better and better to the point that it started beating human players.

Thus machine learning, is in the name which is that a machine learns with time and gets significantly better at performing tasks. Slowly it starts thinking like a human being and therefore its application is called **AI**(**Artificial Intelligence**).
